Greetings and welcome! It's a pleasure to meet you. I am a student at TUM, specializing in Robotics, Cognition, and Intelligence. My passion lies in exploring the realms of Machine Learning and Data Analysis. I'm thrilled to engage in conversations with you, so please don't hesitate to reach out. Let's delve into the fascinating world of technology and knowledge together!

<p> Here is my CV, providing further details about my background and experiences<a href="../files/cv.pdf">CV</a>.</p>

<h2>Skills</h2>

<ul class="skill-list">
	<li>Programming: Python, MATLAB, C</li>
	<li>Data platforms: MySQL, Snowflake</li>
	<li>Data visualization: Power BI</li>
	<li>Machine Learning</li>
	<li>Data Analysis</li>
	<li>Language: English(C2), German(B2)</li>
</ul>

<h2>Projects</h2>

<ul>
	<li><strong>Machine Learning for Medical Images:</strong> 
	<br>- Adapted 2D Y-Net to the 3D domain.
	<br>- Trained the 3D segmentation model in a few-shot setting using meta-learning to tackle the issue of limited medical data availability.
    </li>
	<li><strong>Machine Learning for 3D Reconstruction:</strong>
	<br>- Performed shape reconstruction from a single-view image.
	<br>- Employed a classification network to extract global features and combine them with local features derived from the single-view image. This fusion of features enables the 3D network to acquire sufficient information for successful shape reconstruction.
	</li>
	<li><strong>Autonomous Search and Rescue System:</strong>
	<br>- Utilized a simulated avalanche scene and UAV model built by Unity.
	<br>- Implemented Robot Operating System (ROS) for detector simulation, path planning, trajectory planning, and control.
	</li>
</ul>
